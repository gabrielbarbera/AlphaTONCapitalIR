## Troubleshooting First Deployment

### ❌ Workflow Fails on "Install dependencies"

**Problem**: npm install fails

**Solution**:
```bash
cd build
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix package-lock.json"
git push
```

### ❌ Workflow Fails on "Build production site"

**Problem**: Build command fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd build
npm run build:production

# If fails locally, check for errors
# Fix issues in src/ files
# Commit and push again
```

### ❌ Pages Not Loading

**Problem**: Site deployed but shows 404

**Solution**:
1. Check Settings → Pages is enabled
2. Verify Source is "GitHub Actions"
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Clear browser cache
5. Try incognito/private window

### ❌ Assets Not Loading

**Problem**: HTML loads but CSS/images broken

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify paths are relative (not absolute)
3. Ensure files exist in `src/assets/`
4. Rebuild: `npm run build:production`
5. Commit and push

### ❌ GitHub Pages Not in Settings

**Problem**: Can't find Pages section

**Solution**:
1. Ensure repo is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
2. Check you have admin access
3. Refresh GitHub settings page
